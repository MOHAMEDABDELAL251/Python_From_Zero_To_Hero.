# Python_From_Zero_To_Hero.
This course helps you understand the Python programming language from scratch to an advanced level and build a strong foundation in programming.
At the beginning of the course, the basic concepts of Python were explained, such as:
Taking input using "input"
Printing output using "print"
"Variables" and "different data types"
After that, control statements were explained, including:
"if"
"elif"
"else"
They were used to make decisions inside the program based on specific conditions, such as determining age categories or comparing values.
The course also explained:
"for"
"while"
These were applied in practical programs such as guessing games.
The course also covered lists, where students learned how to:
Create lists
Add elements using "append"
